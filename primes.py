# To use a math function, write "ma." in front of it.  Example:  ma.sin(3.146)

# These functions will ask you for your number ranges, and assign them to 'x1' and 'x2'

# This line will print your two numbers out
print x1, x2

""" Text enclosed in triple quotes is also a comment.
This code should find and output all prime numbers between (and including) the numbers entered initially.
If no prime numbers are found in that range, it should print a statement to the user.
Now we end the comment with triple quotes."""

# The rest is up to you!
